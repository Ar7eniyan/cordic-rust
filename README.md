### [CORDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC) in Rust
Modern computers have fast floating point operations, so other alrorithms are used. That means CORDIC is basically useless on PC processors (~18 times slower with f64 than Rust standard library sin and cos functions together, when doing about the same precision). But I did it just to excersice myself anyways.
